## "Good Faith" Rules (Unofficial rules decided by the community)

`Last updated: 12/17/2024 | Z`

* No griefing is allowed, some exclusions apply when a war has been started. However these will be stated.
* You cannot live on a country's land without having citizenship. (**PER COUNTRY BASIS**)
* You cannot start polls without permission by either a country's leader or unanimous agreement.
* Entity cramming farms, lag machines and rapid chunk loading is not allowed, this causes lag.
* Theft of anything is strictly prohibited, if you did not place it you cannot take it unless the person who placed it says otherwise.
* ~~Please unlock your chests if you're gonna be placing them in a public area.~~ (As of recently, the mod allowing chests to be removed is no longer availabe, thus this rule is invalidated)

People breaking these rules will not recieve any ***OFFICIAL DISCINIPLARY ACTION***, but instead will just be shunned by the community.

## Cibles SMP Client-Side Mod FAQ

`Last updated: 12/17/2024 | Z`

Cibles Staff encourage the use of most client-side mods while maintaining a fair and enjoyable experience for all players. We operate on a common-sense policy: **if your mod is designed for cheating, griefing, hacking, or spamming, it is disallowed.** Previously, the rule was simply ‚Äúany mod that gives you an advantage over other players is against the rules.‚Äù However, due to recent incidents, we are clarifying client-side mod restrictions. Mods that fall into the following disallowed categories, are **primarily used** for the the listed purpose, and have been used in such a manner will result in an **immediate tempban or ban.**

### **Disallowed Mod Categories**
1. **Cheat-Enabling Mods**  
   Mods that enable common cheats, including but not limited to flying, boat flying, potion spoofing, and extended reach mods.

2. **Movement-Altering Mods**  
   Mods that modify player movement.  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - Controller mods  
     - Input lag fixers  
     - Do A Barrel Roll (Elytra Mod)  

3. **Inventory-Altering Mods**  
   Mods that modify the contents of containers, inventories, or Ender Chests (your own or others).  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - Mods that allow viewing (but not altering) of Ender Chest or Shulker Box contents, such as **Shulker Tooltips**  

4. **Teleportation or Speed Mods**  
   Mods that allow teleportation, traversal faster than normal gameplay, or unusual traversal methods.  
   - **Important Note:** Some controller mods and input lag fixers may make your movement appear abnormal. Use these mods at your own risk and appeal any bans via **ModMail**.  

5. **Seed and Structure-Locating Mods**  
   Mods that allow players to see the server seed, locate structures based on the seed, or otherwise find structures faster than others.  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - Minimap mods  
     - Waypoint mods  

6. **Automation Mods**  
   Mods that automate commands, actions, mining, combat, or other game features.  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - Macros  
     - AutoClickers  

7. **X-Ray or Block-Locating Mods**  
   Mods that enable players to locate blocks through walls or use X-Ray-like features.  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - Minimap mods  

8. **Camera-Altering Mods**  
   Mods that modify the player‚Äôs camera view to gain an advantage in combat.  
   - **Exceptions:**  
     - First-person Model  
     - Minimap mods  
     - Freecam (for cinematic purposes)  
     - ReplayMod  

### **Allowed Mods and Exceptions**
These mods are permitted unless otherwise used for disallowed purposes:  
- **Fullbright/Night Vision Mods** (*Cannot be a full potion-spoofing mod, only Night Vision*)  
- **Litematica** (Schematic building mod)  
- **ItemSwapper** (For swapping hotbar items without opening inventory)  
- **Most Resource Packs** (*X-Ray packs are disallowed*)  

### **Explicitly Banned Mods**  
These mods result in an **instant ban with a low chance of appeal**:  
- Meteor Client (and forks) including Baritone (and forks)
- Wurst Client (and forks)  
- Impact Client (and forks)  
- LiquidBounce (and forks)  
- Aristois (and forks)  
- Sigma Client (and forks)  
- CheatUtils (and forks)  
- Ore Compass (and forks)  

### **Important Notes**
- Mods not explicitly mentioned may still fall under disallowed categories. Use common sense and contact staff if unsure.  
- Appeals for bans caused by exceptions (e.g., controller mods causing unintended behavior), by unknowlingly having a mod (e.g., not knowing a mod had certain functionality), or by server staff error (e.g., a staff member false-reports you or sees something that looked like cheating but wasn't) can be made via **ModMail**.  

This FAQ aims to create a balanced and enjoyable environment for all players on Cibles SMP. Please respect these guidelines and enjoy your time on the server!

## How to Join a Bation

`Last updated: 12/17/2024 | Z`

Different nations may ask for different things, but heres the basics;
You must notify a leader, or tell a person of power that you wish to join [Nation name here]. Depending on your history you may or may not be accepted. (most of the time you will be so don't worry) After that you should be enrolled for the nation, and you'll get a role change saying you are a citizen of [Nation name here].

### Duel citizenship

To be a duel citizen you must have affiliations in both countries. Either you have a home in both that you actively use or you have certain things in one country but you have others in another. Both of the countries you wish to have citizenship have to be allied. In the event that allied countries you live in go to war, you may choose a side. It is entirely up to the nations if you are allowed back, or allowed to side with them.

---

## Official War Guidelines

`Last updated: 12/17/2024 | Z`

**You must meet the following criteria to declare (official) war**:
1. All countries must now have at least 4 people 
2. Each country must choose one item to represent their country (will be explained) 
3. Each country must build a GREIFABLE structure in case of conflict, where they will store the item.

### Declaring War

An aggressor must publicly announce a threat of war, the opposing party must have at least 1 person of power online. They can either agree to meet the terms, or resolve the conflict but if it is not resolved then any nations involved go to war. Inside the structures built by the nations there will be the country's chosen item. This item is to be kept in a claimed chest (chest claimed by a leader of that country) with public writing and editing on. That structure will be immune to anti-grieving laws once war starts, and the chest inside of it will be *required* to have writing perms. These perms will be applied to the public permissions, but stay locked so it's not blown up.  Once this item is stolen the opposing country must store it in their own country item chest for ***12 Hours***  in order to win. They *must* make a public announcement in the soon to be finished United Nations Discord server, the timer will be started once the announcement is released. ***BOTH PARTIES MUST BE PINGED.*** If the opposing country does not take their item back, they will be forced to surrender and they will lose the war. If it is smaller countries that war, the bigger  countries have every right to support, or deny support to either side.

### War Crimes

1) Killing pets, or named animals. This includes villagers, monsters, etc. *only if named*. **(THIS IS AGAINST GRIEFING RULES, YOU WILL RECIEVE OFFICIAL CONSEQENCES)**
2) Destruction of player builds, this does not include landscape or war structures. **(THIS IS AGAINST GRIEFING RULES, YOU WILL RECIEVE OFFICIAL CONSEQENCES)**
3) Use of withers in non-underground areas or around player builds  is strictly prohibited. **(THIS IS AGAINST GRIEFING RULES, YOU WILL RECIEVE OFFICIAL CONSEQENCES)**
4) Bombing, stealing, threatening or damage of any kind to nations not involved. **(THIS IS AGAINST GRIEFING RULES, YOU WILL RECIEVE OFFICIAL CONSEQENCES)**
5) Attacking people/structures/mobs that are not included in the war, this includes:
	- Nations not participating
	- People refusing to participate
	- Uniformed World Post Employees
	- Crack Shack War Supply Providers

---

## World Meeting Rules

1) Each country must have 1-3 human delegates.
2) Each country must wear a full leather armor uniform designed for each delegate.
3) No items will be allowed whatsoever, please eat before you enter *includes weapons*. You will be provided a chest to place them in
4) If you attend you cannot be afk (For a long period of time), excuse yourself if needed.
5) Please remain seated in your color coordinated spots unless excused.
6) The meeting room is a peaceful place, any violence inside will result in your country being excluded.
7) In case of emergency we ask that you simply use /home instead of using violence or threats.
