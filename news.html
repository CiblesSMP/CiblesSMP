            <p>Heyo everyone!<br><br>I am <span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, lightpink, hotpink, lightpink, hotpink); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">so excited</span> to announce I have added a feature to now include maps of the Nations & Territories of the server!!<br><br>This is mostly because the #maps channel in the community discord server sat unused and mostly dormant with old outdated maps, so I decided to take it upon my self and manually draw out everybody's borders and put the maps on the site! I tried to do this for as many of the Nations and Territories as I could, and I will still add more later, as well as periodically update the maps once boundries are changed or lots of new buildings are built.</p>

            <p>Heyo everyone. I realized today while working on the website that we haven't yet (at least in discord) defined exactly what the different types of entities on the server actually are.<br><br>So I took the liberty to clarify the different types on the website, and since you guys might not always check the website, I decided to clarify in an announcement as well.<br><br><h2>Nation</h2>A <strong>nation</strong> is a area of land in which a small-large community of people are settled. It usually has a independent government unless it's a part of an empire.<br><br><strong style="font-size: calc(len + 3px)">Official Nations</strong> are nations that have met the <u>requirements for official recognition</u> and have signed up to be officially recognized. The leaders of these nations are included on the World Leaders team, which makes many decisions about the community.<br><br><strong style="font-size: calc(len + 3px)">Unofficial Nations</strong> are nations that are on the server but are either not yet meeting official registration requirements or do not wish to officially register. These are shown here to still promote them, but will not be included in the World Leaders team or decisions made by the team.<br><br><h2>Empire</h2><strong>Empires</strong> are alliances/groups of nations banded together. Usually empires have some kind of overall government and rule over many pieces of land. These can be established when at least one <strong>registered nation</strong> comes together with another nation or territory to form a central government.<br><br><h2>Territory</h2><strong>Territories</strong> are areas of land that contain player-built structures or player-crafted natural landmarks that don't identify as a nation. These can include anything player-built and by default will be named "[player name]'s Territory".</p>

            <p>Hello everyone! Today was fun and I enjoyed my wedding, thank you to all who came. Unfortunately, there were 2 fires today that I have to address instead of enjoying this happy day. Both of the fires were located in the new nation Dark Wood. 2 homes were effected as well as some trees. I've spoken to Zena and we both agree that there is no way that it could have occurred naturally as nothing appeared in the mod log. However, due to nothing appearing in the mod log about said fire we don't know who did it.<br><br>Griefing is usually not an issue so I don't want anyone to feel alarmed. Although I would really like to believe no one did would do things like this, we've had 3 fires in the nation since yesterday that have effected homes.  Please be on the lookout for suspicious activity and have water buckets on hand for the next couple weeks or until we can ensure the person who has done these horrible actions is prosecuted or banned.<br><br><strong>This is a final message to everyone on the server that griefing player made and/or owned terrain and builds is strictly prohibited.</strong> I'm fully aware that many of you abide by the laws of all the countries and general human decency. Which is why I'm sorry to all that enjoy our wonderful server in an appropriate manner. If you have been effected by any player griefing recently please send me or my partner Zena screenshots and The Crack Shack Company will ensure you get either a new home or resources to fix the damage.</p>

            <p>Hi everybody!<br><br>I am so excited to announce that I have finished making this <span style="background: linear-gradient(to right, darkred, darkorange, #B1B100, darkgreen, darkblue, indigo, darkviolet); -webkit-background-clip: text;-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;">BEAUTIFUL</span> feature for you guys to enjoy.<br><br>Introducing v1 of the <strong>Community News</strong> feature. Here you can share announcements and content onto the website from your individual announcement feeds onto the official community website!!! This will provide a bit of a cooler way to announce things. And, guess what? You don't even need to know how to code, all you have to do is send the announcement you want to make in the discord channel inside the community server <code>#web-announcements</code> and your announcement will be added to the site! We also pin the latest important announcements to the top!<br><br><strong>Coming soon</strong>: Sorting annoncements by topic, nation, or user.</p>
